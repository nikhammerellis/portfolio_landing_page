		<p class="projectDescription">This project is for a friend in California who wanted a personal blog to discuss baking methods/techniques, give reviews on dessert shops, and also to have a place for friends and family to request informal orders from her. Deployment and final styling pending.</p>
		<p class="projectDescription">Features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Login and Registration with Validations: only necessary if someone wants to comment on blog entries or place order requests. Password encryption in place.</li>
			<li>Admin Controls: allow admins to author blog entries, list new products, review orders in a table, or view list of users and their info.</li>
			<li>Optional images: blog entries and product listings have the option to upload an image to accompany the content.</li>
			<li>Truncation of blog entries on the main page, with a read more link to the stand alone blog entry. Blog title also links to the show page.</li>
			<li>Order Request Form: allows anyone registered and logged in to request an order from her. Starting out this is informal for friends and family, a shopping cart may be added later if she wants to expand from a hobby to a business</li>
			<li>Secured access to pages: unauthorized access attemps are redirected to the root route.</li>
			<li>Comments: logged in users can comment on blog entries on the show page of each. They are then displayed under the blog entry in ascending order.</li>
			<li>Responsive Design and Layout: using Foundation framework, I was able to have a nice top nav bar on the main page which sticks to the top once you've moved past the logo. It also allowed me to have products listed in a block grid layout. The background image on the main blog page is fixed for a cleaner scrolling experience.</li>
			<li>Most importantly, a happy client</li>
